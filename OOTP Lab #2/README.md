Technical task: Create an ordering system for a computer retailer that sells gaming and workstation computers. The system should allow customers to order a computer by specifying the type of computer (either "gaming" or "workstation"), the brand, model, processor, graphics card, RAM, and motherboard.

The system should use the Builder design pattern to create the appropriate type of computer based on the customer's specifications. Once the computer is built, the system should add it to a list of all computers that have been ordered.

The system should also allow customers to view a list of all the computers that have been ordered, along with their specifications.
