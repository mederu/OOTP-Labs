C# program to simulate a computer store that allows users to add, sell, and restock computers. The program should implement the Chain of Responsibility design pattern to handle the sale and restock requests. The program should also use an Iterator to iterate over the list of available computers and display their details, including their current state (available, sold, or out of stock). The program should include sample data for some computers and should allow the user to interact with the store by typing commands in the console.
